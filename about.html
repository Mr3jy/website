        <p  title="Footprinting">Footprinting is all about seeking out information that can be used to facilitate an attack. In this lesson, you'll learn more about this term, what its uses are, what information is gathered and the process involved.</p>

    <h2>Recon</h2>
    <p>When Osama bin Laden's hideout was raided and he was killed by U.S. Special Forces in May 2011, the entire operation took only 40 minutes to complete. What few may realize is that the planning and preparation that went into that mission took years and years of training and reconnaissance.

        Thanks to the military's reconnaissance executed by the use of satellites, multiple intelligence agencies from inside the United States were able to pinpoint bin Laden's location. This led to a successfully executed mission.
        
        ''Intelligence'' is all around us. It's not exclusive to the military, although they use it efficiently to capitalize on gaining the upper hand on the enemy. In the computer world, the ideas of reconnaissance and intelligence have their own place. In ethical hacking, this information-gathering process is known as footprinting.</p>

        <h2>What is Footprinting?</h2>
        <p>Think about footprinting as looking for every place an organization may leave information about itself. To put it another way, it's searching for in any location where the organization's ''footprint'' can be observed. This is the first and perhaps most critical step in the hacking process.

            Footprinting is about collecting all available information about a computer system or network in order to gain access to it. Unethical hackers perform this task before hacking into a system without permission. In addition, through ethical hacking, organizations today are also engaging in this type of reconnaissance to identify security deficiencies in their systems and networks.
            
            There are two types of footprinting: <ol>
                <li>active</li>
                <li>passive.</li>
                </ol>
             Active footprinting might consist of sending a phishing email to an employee in an attempt to collect proprietary information. Passive footprinting could be as simple as reading a company's website or Googling them to see what information is available about them.</p>

             <h2>Information</h2>
             <p>If you've ever searched for any business or even an individual online, you already know there is a ton of information out there, likely including some things you never expected to find. When undertaking footprinting, there is a wealth of data available for hackers, giving them intelligence about an organization.

                Some of those data points include:
            <ul>
                <li>Company IP address</li>
                <li>Operating sysems on machines</li>
                <li>Network basic</li>
                <li>Employee email addresses</li>
                <li>Web domain names</li>
                <li>Important phone numbers</li>
                <li>Identities of key figures in an organization</li>
                <li>Origanizational policies</li>
                <li>Current or future project information or changes</li>
                <li>Legal details or documents</li>
                <li>News coverage or press releses</li>
                <li>A company's patents and trademarks</li>
                <li>Presentations, webinars and articals</li>
            </ul></p>

            <h2>Uses</h2>
            <p>The process of footprinting and gathering the aforementioned information may be useful in the following scenarios:
                <ul>
                <li><b>Reducing or eliminating attacks.</b> Once security vulnerabilities are addressed, the likelihood of threats can be decreased.</li>
                <li><b>Finding weaknesses.</b> Knowing where vulnerabilities exist, a company can work to correct them.</li>
                <li><b>Identifying security posture.</b> A company that engages in footprinting can get a more clear picture of security strengths and weaknesses.</li>
                <li><b>Laying the foundation for an attack.</b> This is the methodology hackers will employ to find weak points through which they can launch their attack.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Footprinting How-To</h2>
            <p>Before a hacker would attempt to break into a computer system or network, he or she would want to understand it, right? Think about it in terms of a burglar who cases a home or business before physically breaking in. The burglar looks for things like alarm systems, cameras, dogs on the premises or the schedule of the homeowners before attempting entry.

                The following are a set of steps an attacker may perform when footprinting an organization.</p>
